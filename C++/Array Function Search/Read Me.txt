C++ functions for search algorithms.
Vectors have been used.

Binary Search:
	int binary_search(T* ar, int size, T searchedValue)
		Array must be sorted.
		Returns index of searchedValue.
		Returns -1 if not found.

Linear Search:
	vector<int> linear_search(T* ar, int size, T searchedValue)
		Returned vector consists of indexes of all encounters of searchedValue troughtout the array.

Pattern Matching:
	vector<T> pattern_matching(vector<T> data, vector<T> pattern)
		Vectors remember thier sizes therefore (..,int size,..) is not present.
		Returned vector consists of indexes of start index of each matched pattern in data.
